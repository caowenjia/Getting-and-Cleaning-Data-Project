This is the final project for this course. The raw data collected are usually very messy, which stops us from doing productive anylysis to extract valuable information from them. So the first and most important thing is to get the data in a user friendly format. 

The data are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The raw data are sotred at:

Per the course's requirment, I need to submit to following:

1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

The work I need perform is:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
