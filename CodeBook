This codebook illustrate what I've done to to clean the data(For detailed requirement, please refer to readme.md).

THe raw data collected,for both train and test, the varible labels, the subjects and the data are all stored in seprated txt files.

To have a better idea of the data. I first merge the datasets together to create a complete dataset with all necessary information - descriptive labels and all the necessary inforamtion: subject, the type of activety when the metrics are generated. So after this step, there are two datasets -- train and test, both of which are tidy datasets.

With these two tidy data sets in hand, simply combine them together by rows will get a dataset wiht all subjects.

To keep only the varibles with mean and standard deviation. I looked into features to search for "mean" and "sted" as keywords, and that gives an arry indicates the column numbers that we are looking for. And them extract the corresponding columns and vola here comes the dataset that only contains meansurements on mean and standard deviation. in addition to that, to make the datasets more illustrative, I also include the subjects and activity code as part of the datsets.


Since activity description is part of the raw data, simply merge it with the dataset generated above will get descritpive names about each actively, and hence I named the new varible "Activity_desc". 

And since the dataset I created in the first step already have descritive labels, so by now only the final summary is needed.

The final step is to summarize the means by activity and subject. The final data sets contains the following varibles: 



INDENTIFIERS

subject - The ID of the test subject(There are total 30 subjects)
Activity_cd - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken(1-6)
Activity_desc - The corresponding activity description.
